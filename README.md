# Innovative Idea
We plan to create a website specific about pets(cat, dog, hamsters...),help pet owners from all over the world share pet's moment and hold offline party.

# Important Components
User can create a profile for the pets include imageï¼Œpet's name, breed, age, living place.

Pet owners can share their pets' moments by uploading short videos or images while other users can thumb up or leave a comment.

Helping pet owners to hold an offline party is the main purpose of the website. The party holder first posts the time, location, contact info, pet info, and activity description, and then invites others to join. Users who are not invited can send request to the holder. When a member joins, the website asks him/her to fill in his/her contact info and pet info, then update the info to the party.
